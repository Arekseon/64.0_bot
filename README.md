in order to start the bot, 
1. first you have to make sure you are running mac(tested on 10.11 and 10.12)
2. suffer through all the dependencies hell that i am too lazy to specify now
3. open the game 64.0 in window mode, which you of course paid for in steam
4. allign it in a perfect position on the screen which is (28, 46, 640, 640) (left upper corner of the screen) or modify thos digits in the file screenshot_taker.py to the location of your game windows on the screen
5. die on any level of the game and while being on the game over screen run the script with "python bot_2.py"
